# BorwellChallenge
A Paint calculator that displays in the console written in JAVA 
This Application takes in measurements from the User by using the console.
It then calcualtes 
The volume of the room.
The area of the floor.
The amount of paint needed.

If I was to spend more time on this project. I would create a calculator for the excluded area. I would also include the ability for the program to work out paint needed for more than one coat
